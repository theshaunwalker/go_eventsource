This is a dummy event sourcing package I'm writing as a way to learn Go.

Included is a dummyapp folder where I'm currently dumping all my dog-fooding code.

# Am I doing something wrong~?

This is my learning exercise and I welcome any feedback!

Please feel free to raise an issue to point out stuff thats against best practices or I'm doing things in a non-performant way.
